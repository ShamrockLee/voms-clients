== NAME

vomses - The VOMS server contact table

== SYNOPSIS

*/etc/vomses* 

*~/.glite/vomses*

== DESCRIPTION

This manual page describes the format of _vomses_ files.
_vomses_ files contain contact information for VOMS servers and are typically organized in the */etc/vomses* directory.
A _vomses_ file is a simple text file which contains one or more lines formatted as follows:

"vo_name" "hostname" "port" "server DN" "alias"

Where:

*vo_name*: the name of the VO served by the VOMS server 

*hostname*: the hostname where the VOMS server is running

*port*: the port where the VOMS server is listening for incoming requests

*server DN*: the certificate subject of the VOMS server

*alias*: an alias that can be used for this VOMS server (this is typically identical to the vo_name)

System wide VOMSES configuration is maintained in the */etc/vomses* file or directory.
If */etc/vomses* is a directory, all the files contained in such directory are parsed looking for VOMS
contact information.

A user can define its custom *vomses* configuration in the *~/.glite/vomses* file or directory, which
will be parsed in the same way as just described.

== EXAMPLES

The following is an example of valid vomes file for the *cms* VO:

----
"cms" "lcg-voms.cern.ch" "15002" "/DC=ch/DC=cern/OU=computers/CN=lcg-voms.cern.ch" "cms"
"cms" "voms.cern.ch" "15002" "/DC=ch/DC=cern/OU=computers/CN=voms.cern.ch" "cms"
----
