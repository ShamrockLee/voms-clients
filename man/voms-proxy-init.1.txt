VOMS-PROXY-INIT(1)
==================
:doctype: manpage


NAME
----
voms-proxy-init - create a proxy with VOMS extensions


SYNOPSIS
--------
*voms-proxy-init* [options]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The voms-proxy-init generates a proxy with the VOMS information included in a non critical extension.


OPTIONS
-------
Options  may be specified indifferently with either a "-" or "--" prefix. 
The options from -help to -out are present for compatibility with grid-proxy-init, 
and have the exact same meaning. The meaning of the other ones is the following.

*-help*

*-usage* Displays usage

*-version* Displays version

*-debug* Enables extra debug output

*-quiet* Quiet mode, minimal output

*-verify* Verifies proxy

*-pwstdin* Allows passphrase from stdin

*-limited* Creates a limited proxy

*-hours* <H> Proxy is valid for H hours (default:12) This option is deprecated and is only present for 
compatibility with grid-proxy-init, since this option does not set the validity of the credentials returned 
by VOMS. Use -valid instead.

*-vomslife* <H> Tries to get a pseudo cert with information valid for H hours. The default is "as long as the 
proxy certificate". The special value 0 means as long as the server will allow. This option is deprecated, 
since it does not set the validity of the generated proxy. Use -valid instead.

*-valid* <HH:MM> This option attempts to set the validity for both the proxy and the credentials returned by the
VOMS server. The latter validity may however be shortened due to server policy. This option obsoletes both
-hours and -vomslife, and should be used in preference to both

*-bits* <B> Number of bits in key {0|512|1024|2048|4096}. 0 is a special value which means: same number of bits
as in the issuing certificate.

*-cert* <certfile> Non-standard location of user certificate

*-key*  <keyfile> Non-standard location of user key

*-certdir* <certdir> Non standard location where the trusted CAs certificates are kept.

*-out* <proxyfile> Location of new proxy cert

*-voms* <voms[:command]> Specifies the VOMS server to contact using the nickname voms. It also allows to send
a specific command to the server. The default command is :all, and it gets all group membership information. 
Other commands are :/Role=rolename which grants the rolename VO-wide role  if  the  server allows it, and 
:/group/Role=rolename which grants the role rolename only in the group /group, again only if the server allows it.
Example : voms-proxy-init --voms myVO:/myVO/Role=VO-Admin

*-order* <fqan> Specified fqans, if present, are put on top of the list of attributes returned by the server in the
order in which they are passed (using more -order call). The order of the others is not specified. If some of the fqans
are not returned no warning is given. Capability selection is not supported.

*-include* <file> Includes file in the certificate (in a non critical extension)

*-conf* <file> Read options from file.
 
*-confile* <file>

*-userconf* <file>

*-vomses* <file> Specifies  the  name  of a configuration file from which a list of nicknames is read. The format of the 
file is the following: nick  host port  subject  vo where nick is the nickname, host and port are the hostname 
and port of the server to contact, subject is the subject  of  the  server's certificate, while vo is the name of
the VO that owns the server. The default filenames are $PREFIX/etc/vomses and $HOME/.voms/vomses.

Moreover, permissions must be 644 if a file is specified, and 755 if a directory is specified

The three options are synonyms. -confile and -userconf are deprecated. -vomses should be used instead.

*-policy* The file containing the policy expression.

*-policy-language* <pl>

*-pl* <pl> The language in which the policy is expressed. Default is IMPERSONATION_PROXY.

*-path-length* Maximum depth of proxy certfificate that can be signed from this.

*-globus* <version> Underlying Globus version. This will influence the default value of the -proxyver.

*-proxyver* Version of the proxy certificate to create. May be 2, 3 or 4. Default value is decided upon underlying globus version.

*-rfc* This option is a synonym of -proxyver 4 and it generates a RFC-compliant proxy.

*-old* This option is a synonym of -proxyver 2 and it generates a legacy proxy.

*-target*  hostname This option targets the generated AC to a specific host. This option may be specified multiple times to allow for multiple hosts.

*-timeout* <seconds> This option allows to specify the maximum number of seconds that voms-proxy-init will wait
 while trying to establish a connection with the server. Its default value is -1 (unlimited).

*-noregen* Use existing proxy to contact the server and to sing the new proxy.

*-separate* <file> Saves the voms credential on file file.

*-ignorewarn* Ignore all warnings. They are not shown to the user.

*-failonwarn* Warnings become failures. The program will translates all warnings into errors and will react accordingly, by returning a failure itself.

*-list* Instead of producing an attribute certificate, this optin will print on screen a list of all attributes available to the user.

*-includeac* <file> Adds the VOMS AC in file to the proxy.
